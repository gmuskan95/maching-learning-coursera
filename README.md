# Maching Learning (coursera)
This repo is created for all the assignments done by me as a part of Coursera's Machine Learning Course by Stanford University taught by Prof. Andrew Ng. 
Please try to solve the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to go through the code. :)
